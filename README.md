# Zoomer Shell
A completly moronic shell that is created for the averege zoomer.
## Current commands
- yeet - remove file (equivalent to rm command) 🤯
- uwumake - equivalent of touch 🥰
- vibecheck - shows system uptime 🥳
- nocapgoto - equivalent of cd command 😬
- ick - exits the shell after a thorough confiramtion 😁
- spillthetea - shows all files in the current directory (ls command equivalent) 😎
- flexstatus - shows current git repo status (git status equivalent) 🤩
- whereami - shows current directory (pwd equivalent) 🤔

Important to note that pressing ctrl + c to exit will not work cause this shell makes sure you REALLY want to exit 😇
